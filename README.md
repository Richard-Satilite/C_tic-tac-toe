  <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a tic-tac-toe game that uses the terminal as an interactive interface for the user.
    The language of this project is <strong>PT-BR</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works and Usage</h2>
  <p>Initially, an interactive menu is displayed, offering the following options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play against the computer.</li>
    <li>Multiplayer (local).</li>
    <li>A manual on how to play.</li>
    <li>Exit the game.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The game starts with the user selecting the desired game mode. The current board configuration will then be displayed. During the game:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user selects the row and column where they wish to make their move.</li>
    <li>In "Against the Computer" mode, the computer will make its move immediately after the player's turn, and its chosen position will be displayed.</li>
    <li>In multiplayer mode, the second player will be prompted to select the desired row and column after the first player's turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    The game ends in the following scenarios:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A winning configuration (by the computer or any player) is achieved.</li>
    <li>The game ends in a draw.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies</h2>
  <p>The program was developed entirely in the <strong>C programming language</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    This is an old program created for educational purposes only. Therefore, the project's structure might not follow best programming practices. 
    The code was developed before the author learned about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic memory allocation.</li>
    <li>Pointers.</li>
    <li>Best practices for <code>structs</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only simple and basic structures were used.</p>
